					<p>Dear James Hay,</p>
					<p>We open on the vast moors in Scotland during the hot, hot summer of 1889. A teenage girl is discovered  running through the heather, her dress torn and her face a mess. She is striking with black hair and  piercing blues eyes. This is YOUNG MAY, our hero. In a series of quickfire scenes we establish that this is a very head strong young woman struggling with the constraints of Victorian life; fighting with her  mother about her freedom; fending off a male suitor who belittles her. But the mood changes suddenly  as we are transported to a cold stark room. YOUNG MAY sat alone. She looks terrified and close to  tears. A nun appears and proceeds to cut YOUNG MAY’s hair off. She then places a brand new  ‘cornette’ on YOUNG MAY’s head and tells her, ‘You have nothing to fear.’</p>
